# 100 Days of CUDA Learning

This repository contains my journey of learning CUDA over 100 days.

## Run 

cmake ..
make
./days/day001/day001_vector_add

OR

./run.sh <Daynumber>

## Project Structure

- `common/`: Common utility code used across multiple days
- `days/`: Individual daily exercises and experiments
- `projects/`: Larger mini-projects spanning multiple days
- `data/`: Sample data for projects
- `tests/`: Unit tests
